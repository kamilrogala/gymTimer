# Project: gymTimer

Project for "maintaining" exercise. Sometimes is quite difficult to count repeats, series and their times during some heavy exercise. So... it's counting your exercise, breaks and everything!
I've made this tools long time ago but it's quite helpful for me even nowadays.

# How to use

Very simple thing- just type every data into inputs, turn on sound on your computer/tablet/mobile and go.
Have a nice excersise :muscle:

# ToDo

I know that this code sucks. Yeah, really- children don't do this at home, school or anywhere. It's bad! :grimacing:
But I have plan to rewrite it... one day, maybe :smirk:

- [X] do some cleaning in HTML (what the...)
- [X] do some cleaning in CSS (holy moly...)
- [X] do some cleaning with folders and files (...kill me)
- [X] upload this crap on GitHub
- [X] start thinking about refactoring
- [X] translate to english
- [ ] stop changing anything. Just start this from scratch...
- [ ] rewrite to ES6
- [ ] optimize
- [ ] rewrite to functional form
- [ ] give some nice animations and CSS (I like fancy things)
- [ ] transcrpit by babel
- [ ] minify
